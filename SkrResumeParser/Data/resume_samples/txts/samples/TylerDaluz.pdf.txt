FT/Citi Ingenuity Awards Program
2011 to 2013
Members:Tyler Daluz

More than half of the world’s population lives in cities today, a number which is expected to rise in the
 decades ahead. As a result, cities have a pressing need to address the challenges of urbanisation and find
 solutions that modernise infrastructure, improve efficiency, enhance quality of life and foster sustainable
 growth and development.

The FT/Citi Ingenuity Awards: Urban Ideas in Action, a global programme sponsored by Citi, was developed
 to recognise leaders, teams, organisations and community groups that have developed groundbreaking
 solutions to urban challenges that benefit cities, citizens and urban communities in the fields of education,
 energy, healthcare and infrastructure.
