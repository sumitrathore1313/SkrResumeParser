Senior Community Growth Specialist (September 2012 - April 2015)
That title is just a fancy attempt to describe being a jack of all trades on the Community Growth team. I

 manager. And a part-time podcast producer.

(This was the organization formerly known as CHAOS.) I observed and advised a team that oversaw special

 Staff.
