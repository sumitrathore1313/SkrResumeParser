Senior Creative Strategist/Producer at Imagination At Play

9 people have recommended Patrick S.

"I've known Patrick for many many years. He's great to work with and he's easy to talk to. He loves to
communicate with the team to make sure everyone's on the same page. He's very meticulous in how things
are done and stresses efficiency. He's not afraid to vocalize issues and bring it to the table to discuss. He
has a skill to break things down and clearly verbalize how he's feeling, how the team is feeling, what needs
to be done, and how to address the problem. His background in teaching (in Japan: after learning an entire
language on his own) also gave him leadership skills to help guide people through any challenges. He's super
organized and prefers to keep everything neat and clean. He's funny, and makes sure everyone else has fun
along the way. He loves to help people (does a lot of charity work) and has a great heart. If there's one thing
that I admire the most about Patrick is that he NEVER gives up no matter what the circumstances are. Just
keeps pushing forward. It's kind of amazing. Wouldn't give it a second thought it work with Patrick again. "

— Steve Lee, Designer, Imagination At Play, worked directly with Patrick S. at Imagination At Play

"Patrick is an extremely bright and hard-working professional who I had the pleasure of working with on on
multiple projects. He is extremely detail-oriented, highly motivated and brings a positive, get it done attitude
to ensure success on his productions. Several important details that would be easy to miss were caught and
addressed by Patrick, and that level of thoroughness and commitment is one of his great strengths. I consider
myself fortunate to have had Patrick manage the projects we collaborated on. He would undoubtedly make a
very strong and invaluable addition to any organization and team."

— George Lee, Executive Producer, Hello Design, managed Patrick S. at Hello Design

"Strategy? Project management? Social media chops? Concepts? Creativity? Yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes.
Fantastic travel stories? Yep. Want to learn about where to eat in Tokyo? Or how the Lakers are looking this
year? Ask Patrick. He knows a lot about a lot. I worked with him on a challenging 360 campaign for Speedo
and numerous projects for Facebook that needed the right combination of business strategy and creativity
—Patrick always helped the team find the right balance. Go ahead. Hire him. He’ll make your days more
efficient, creative, and fun. "
