Experience
Co-founder  at   Pedago, LLC
April 2013  -  Present (3 years 4 months)

Building a faster, more effective way to learn online. Developers of the world's first mobile-ready MBA.

Director of Software Development  at   Rosetta Stone
April 2012  -  March 2013  (1 year)

Transitioned to a dual role on ReFLEX, managing product requirements as Executive Producer while
 continuing to function as Tech Lead. Wrote user stories, resolved technical and content questions, prioritized
 requests from the go-to-market teams, analyzed data and built custom analytics dashboards, and pitched in
 with a bit of code and artwork when needed. Role included significant communication and coordination with
 sales and marketing groups in South Korea and Japan.

Software Architect  at   Rosetta Stone
August 2009  -  April 2012  (2 years 9 months)

As Software Architect, I drove the technology roadmap for the SDQA organization, spearheading new
 product architecture development, reviewed software design proposals, lead internal standardization and
 code management efforts, organized workstreams for cross-team coordination, and otherwise helped projects
 succeed as a floating development resource.

In February 2011, I took over as technical lead of the company's newest language learning product, ReFLEX.
 I supervised a team of 9 developers as we brought the application to market. Unique aspects of this project
 include an AI backend with adaptive daily lessons, just-in-time matchmaking of live video sessions with
 professional language coaches, and an accelerated development process incorporating daily production
 rollouts.

Product Owner: Mobile Applications  at   Rosetta Stone
August 2009  -  April 2010  (9 months)

Page1

Concurrent to my new role as Software Architect, I directed the newly formed Mobile Applications team,
 defining and delivering the initial version of our first iPhone app, Rosetta Stone Mobile Companion.

Responsibilities included:
 * Requirements gathering, product definition with stakeholders, project planning
 * Mockups and user experience flows
 * Working with design consultants to iterate on production artwork
 * Working with internal language experts to adapt RS curriculum content for the mobile device
 * Small feature contributions, code review

Technologies: Objective-C/Cocoa, iOS

Scrum Master: Social Applications  at   Rosetta Stone
July 2008  -  August 2009  (1 year 2 months)

Following the release of Rosetta Stone Manager I was given charge of the newly formed Social Applications
 team. The goal was to create a suite of casual language learning games that would form one of the 3 pieces of
 the new TOTALe product. The role later expanded to include work outside of the original charter of the team
 to support the overall TOTALe deliverable.

Tasks included:
 * Collaborating with dozens of engineers and stakeholders to envision and build TOTALe
 * Brainstormed and collaborated on implementation of an architecture for game-to-game communication/
state coordination built on a pub/sub abstraction; allowed for development of games without per-game web
 services
 * Collaborated on a novel NoSQL-like persistence layer for the games to support the "generic platform"
 approach
 * Collaborated on creation of a social applications "game framework"; provides consistent game chrome,
 improved mocking and test harness support, and templates for deployment and CI
 * Managing several projects, including Studio (our online classroom product) when it was folded into the
 team

Technologies: AS3, Flex, Ruby/Rails, SQL, XML, RTMP/RTMFP, LCCS (formerly CoCoMo)

Scrum Master: RS Manager  at   Rosetta Stone
July 2007  -  June 2008  (1 year)

Upon completion of the Version 3 product, I immediately transitioned to leading a team of 4 developers
 charged with creating an institutional "manager" for the Version 3 application. The solution would allow
 schools, corporations, and other large organizations to manage usage of Rosetta Stone, including advanced
 reporting and curriculum customization features. The product was made available as both a multi-tenancy

Page2

 service hosted by Rosetta Stone, as well as a standalone server that could be deployed entirely within the
 customer's site.

New responsibilities included:
 * Leading a distributed team that was almost entirely remote from the main RS office (a first for the
 company)
 * Managing the scrum process
 * Defining requirements with stakeholders (moonlighting as a Product Owner during this time)
 * Maintaining the RS culture in this new office

Technologies: AS3, Flex, Ruby/Rails, SQL, C/C++, Objective-C, MSI/InstallShield, PackageMaker

Software Developer  at   Rosetta Stone
January 2006  -  July 2007  (1 year 7 months)

I worked on the team that built the Version 3 rewrite of the Rosetta Stone application. The application needed
 to run on Mac and PC via CD install, as well as online. Our goal was a fully-immersive language learning
 experience, with an intuitive interface containing little to no explanatory text. 

My responsibilities included:
 * Choosing a technology platform (decided on Actionscript 3 + Flex 2)
 * Initial application architecture
 * Speech experience and technology integration
 * Working with a vendor to enable Flash on the desktop
 * Maintaining the vision of the original labs prototype as we rebuilt and extended its functionality for
 production
 * Assisting in user experience brainstorming, mockup creation, and user testing
 * Assisted in debugging and refining solution for display of tricky international character sets (ligatures,
 bidirectional scripts, etc.)

Technologies: AS3, Flex, Ruby/Rails, Java, C/C++, XML, SQLite, Perl

Software Developer in Labs  at   Rosetta Stone
May 2005  -  January 2006  (9 months)

I was part of a small team that iterated on the prototype that would become the model for Rosetta Stone
 Version 3. Besides brainstorming and hacking on the codebase, I ran user tests, implemented a basic
 ticketing system to track the team's work, and drove some documentation efforts. When the project
 transitioned from research to full-on product development, I was the team lead charged with maintaining the
 vision of the prototype as we rewrote it for production.

Perhaps my biggest contribution was the speech recognition user experience. In addition to creating and
 polishing a novel "hands free" speech UI, I also evaluated a number of SRE technologies, commercial and
 academic, running bake-offs and comparing recognition accuracy. This included a bunch of Perl and Ruby
 scripting to clean up and organize our corpus of recorded speech data + transcriptions in order to construct
 test speech models with a research group in Boulder, CO. The results of this effort heavily informed the
 company's decision to bring this group aboard as the foundation of Rosetta Stone speech research lab.

Intern/Software Developer  at   Rosetta Stone
May 2002  -  May 2005  (3 years 1 month)

Rosetta Stone was a small company when I first began working there, with just a handful of technical folks
 on-hand. As such, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to tackle big projects early on.

My first assignment was a rewrite of the online license server, giving me a chance to play with Java, servlets,
 EJBs, JBoss and the like. Challenges included reverse-engineering the protocol (and associated encryption),
 factoring the problem into a multi-stage filter pipeline for simplified protocol extension, creating a multi-
threaded load test agent, and working with a second developer in the design of the underlying EJB structure.
 Incidentally, this was my first Java program. Years later, I would revisit this legacy code to help scale the
 server preparation for a large contract with the Army.

After finishing the license server ahead of schedule, I was handed the task of creating the backend for the
 rosettastone.com website refresh. At the time, XML+XSLT was hot stuff, and our writers/designers wanted
 to be able to craft the site using these technologies. Browser support was lacking, and Apache Cocoon was
 quite unstable at the time, so I ended up writing a servlet-based solution from scratch to handle managing
 the site content, including XML/XSLT transformation, caching, and HTML forms. This would run the main
 rosettastone.com site for several years until we switched to Ruby on Rails and more traditional CMS setup.

I also worked on a number of other web projects, including leading a team that built a Cocoon-based
 language learning site that could be customized and integrated into other institutions' websites. At the end
 of my final internship year, I transitioned to a research-oriented team, exploring ideas that would eventually
 lead to the Version 3 rewrite of the core Rosetta Stone product.

"Ori is a technical leader who gets things done. I would buy stock in any company he works for. He
efficiently and effectively builds great products and makes the right tradeoffs. He easily straddles technical
and organizational leadership roles. The teams he ran at Rosetta Stone were run and organized very
efficiently, and several times he created technical and organizational processes that were later adopted by
other teams. In all of his leadership roles he remained technical enough to understand, simplify and optimize
all the technical tradeoffs being made by his team members. He's a pleasure to work for and with because he
is organized, a great communicator, and always treats everyone with respect."

"For the past two years, Ori was my manager at Rosetta Stone. The strongest endorsement I can give
him is that I would work for him again in a heartbeat. As a manager, Ori excelled at identifying all the
business requirements for our project and distilling them into clear, focused goals. He was also exceptional
at identifying the strengths and weakness of the team and planning accordingly, making our team one of
the most efficient and productive teams at the company. But what makes Ori an unparalleled leader is the
passion and drive he brings to every endeavor. That passion is infectious and made our team not only more
productive and successful at meeting business goals but more positive and happy as well. Furthermore, Ori
is an exceptional programmer which enables him to contribute in a myriad of ways beyond managing. From
architecting new products to assessing the risks of different technological strategies to writing code during

can learn a lot from him. He is exceptional at managing teams, providing the info they need, writing clear
requirements and giving the time needed to get it done under tight release schedules. I worked for him on
a team that was the envy of the company for its rapid release ability and sophisticated approach to release
management. The groundwork for the team's success was laid down by Ori. I knew I could always go to Ori
with concerns or issues and would come away with thoughtful guidance as to the best way forward. I truly
hope to work with Ori in the future."

— Bob Cronin, worked indirectly for Ori at Rosetta Stone

"I had the good fortune of working for Ori as he headed up the ReFLEX product at Rosetta Stone. The
product represented an entirely new direction for how innovative applications were developed within
the company; incorporating agile, rapid-release iterative methodologies, with Ori personally leading the
charge. His technical acumen and breadth of understanding of all things development is staggering to say
the least, and his ability to keep up with emerging trends in technology is downright scary. He has a holistic
understanding of the demands on a business from the daily internal workings needed to facilitate cross-
team product development, to the external users' desires. He has a particular zeal for capturing user metrics
in depth and performing the analysis required to allow product iteration to continue in the right direction.
Ori provided just the right amount of oversight and had the proper trust in our team to allow us to innovate
outside the box while remaining focused on the customer. I couldn't ask for a better mentor and sincerely
hope I have the opportunity to work alongside him again."

— Brent Dearth, reported to Ori at Rosetta Stone

"I've had the pleasure of working with Ori since he first arrived at Rosetta Stone. Ori joined us as an
outrageously young, smart, hard working, creative, interdisciplinary team member. When we were recruiting
young talent, we consistently asked ourselves, "Where can we find more Ori's?" It's been incredibly gratifying
to watch Ori grow into a mature team leader, with the creative vision and skills at planning and execution
to do amazing things. Ori has been a pleasure to work with. His grasp of the various aspects that go into a
project (scope, requirements, effort, cost, business/brand strategy, etc.) makes him a valued colleague and
a valued asset to the organization as a whole. And ultimately his ability to see the big picture made him an
obvious choice to direct all of software development. Ori is among the brightest, most energetic, likable
colleagues I've ever had. Any organization will be lucky to have him."

— Jack Marmorstein, worked directly with Ori at Rosetta Stone

"Ori is a rare find. I feel very fortunate to have worked with Ori on different projects during my time as
RosettaStone. I have worked with him on projects where he was a developer and scrum master and have also
worked with him on other projects where he was the product owner. Irrespective of his role, I always found
Ori executing the projects flawlessly. Ori understand the business, technical and leadership challenges very
well and always finds creative solutions to resolve them. Not only is Ori an awesome developer, product
owner and a people manager but he's also an awesome person who is such a pleasure to work with. I would
be thrilled beyond words to work with Ori again and I recommend him to any organization looking for A
players."

— Ruchi Sabharwal, worked indirectly for Ori at Rosetta Stone

"Ori is a person with many gifts. Aside from his warm and pleasant personality, he possesses a unique
combination of technical, business, and leadership skills. If all that were not enough, he’s incredibly
intelligent. I’ve watched a consistent pattern over the years where Ori is assigned to lead the most challenging
projects and teams. This occurs because it’s widely known that when Ori is managing a project team, the
work will get done on time and the quality will be superb. Further, Ori has a tireless work ethic, is incredibly
organized, and is extremely passionate about his work. I could go on, but I will close by saying that I highly
recommend Ori for any organization looking for perfection!"

— Dave Seyna, worked directly with Ori at Rosetta Stone

"Ori was my ideal manager. His own breathtaking talents and generous nature inspired rather than
intimidated, and he has a fine sense of when to give developers free-reign and when to bring the hammer
down. He supported his entire team selflessly, and all of us have grown into our careers with his ready
assistance. He is also a practical visionary. His voracious appetite for knowledge and ability to keep abreast
of cutting-edge development practices (without ever seeming to fall behind in his own work or limiting
our access to him) allowed him to see the future and plot an aggressive course toward it. Whatever our
team did, other teams followed on six months later. Ori has deep technical knowledge in a variety of
domains, embodies managerial excellence, and was a true thought leader in the organization. He is capable of
anything."

— Jeffrey Dettmann, reported to Ori at Rosetta Stone

"Ori is easily one of the most talented developers I have had the privilege of working with. He has the ability
to focus on low-level problems without losing sight or sense of higher level systems, objectives, and trends.
I've worked alongside him as a developer as well as in his more recent Product Owner and Architect roles,
and I've always been impressed with his conduct and ability to deliver high-quality results. I hope to work
with him again should the opportunity arise."

— Brian Vaughn, worked directly with Ori at Rosetta Stone

"Ori is a genius. He is one of the most well-rounded and intelligent developers with whom I have ever
worked. He can quickly acquire an excellent grasp of complex problems, he has great intuition, and he is a
very effective mentor for less experienced team members. I have learned a great deal from Ori and I think he
is a fantastic developer."

— Scott Fanetti, worked indirectly for Ori at Rosetta Stone
