Experience
Data Associate  at   Allovue
April 2016  -  Present (4 months)

2015 Fellow  at   Venture for America
October 2014  -  Present (1 year 10 months)

Venture for America is a career accelerator for recent grads who want to learn how to build a business while
 making an impact. VFA Fellows get training and join a startup in an emerging US city (Baltimore), where
 we live and work for two years at partner companies (Allovue). We learn hands-on what it takes to build
 a company, while getting the mentorship, network, and ongoing support to prepare ourselves to become
 successful entrepreneurs. VFA's goal is to spark job growth in cities that need it by sending our top-talent to
 help grow the businesses that will make it happen.

Customer Success  at   Allovue
August 2015  -  April 2016  (9 months)

As the first dedicated Customer Success hire, I helped identify, brainstorm, and implement the processes that
 are still in place for on-boarding and supporting product users. This required developing in-depth knowledge
 and familiarity with such systems as Intercom, Heap Analytics, Survey Monkey, TalkDesk, and Mixpanel. I
 have provided one-on-one coaching and on-boarding for users both virtually and in-person, as well as group
 coaching sessions. Specific projects I have contributed to and executed on include creating our first in-house
 analytics dashboard and writing our second email on-boarding campaign for users.

Consulting Intern  at   Rescue Mission of Trenton
July 2014  -  September 2014  (3 months)

The Rescue Mission of Trenton is a housing and rehabilitation facility for recovering addicts, most of whom
 have experience with the Justice System. 

The Mission's Job Development Program empowers residents with the skills to regain control of their lives.
 As a Rescue Mission Intern, I explored the possibility of expanding the job training and job placement
 opportunities for the resident clients in their rehabilitation center. I was especially focused on identifying
 what similar job development programs have found to be successful. 

The Rescue Mission partners with many local community organizations. I worked to identify potential
 entrepreneurial partners in the community for both their work missions and their community service
 community.

Marketing Agent, Office of Athletics- Campus Recreation  at   Princeton University
September 2012  -  June 2013  (10 months)

As a member of one of the earliest marketing teams for Campus Recreation, I worked to brainstorm and
 develop a series of strategies that could be utilized and compared for efficiency. I also implemented
 and expanded the use of social media for increased interaction with the student body, including the
 implementation of QR Codes on fliers which seamlessly connected print media with online sign ups.

Teaching Assistant  at   Princeton University Preparatory Program
June 2012  -  August 2012  (3 months)

With the Princeton University Preparatory Program, I planned lessons for  low-income, high-achieving high
 school students in a number of academic areas, including Literature, Earth Science, Math, Writing, and Art
 Appreciation. I worked directly with the students to guide them in producing their first independent research
 projects that were then presented at the conclusion of the program.

Shift Leader  at   Dunkin Donuts
August 2007  -  September 2011  (4 years 2 months)

As a Shift Leader, I was responsible for the well-being of the entire shift, ranging from proper money
 handling for over a thousand dollars in cash, product quality maintenance and guest satisfaction, and precise
 cleaning techniques. I held this position throughout High School. On extended breaks from school, I have
 regularly picked up shifts because they are still impressed with my quality of work.

Intern  at   Congressman Leonard Lance
August 2010  -  June 2011  (11 months)

As the only intern during the academic year, I was responsible for handling a myriad of tasks. I was often the
 first line of communication with constituents both by print and phone. I was there throughout my senior year
 of High School.

 collegiate chapters in the United States and Canada and 307 alumnae associations worldwide Their national

May 2016  -  Present

The Stars & Stripes Alumnae Association was formed to benefit all of our Kappa alumnae that are affiliated
 with the military whether a spouse, parent, sibling or active duty soldier. The goal of our association is to
 provide a connection for all military affiliated alumnae to the Kappa Kappa Gamma organization no matter
 where they may be located. This organization also functions as a wonderful information sharing resource
 whether just starting your affiliation with the military or those alumnae that are more seasoned in their
 military background.
