1 person has recommended Pavika (PJ)

"For TEDxCambridge 2013, a 600-attendee evening-long TEDx event, PJ created the event’s signage. This
included everything from speaker posters to TEDx banners to TEDx stencils. As Operations Director, I gave
her entire creative responsibility for the signage design and she delivered very well! The designs she created
were attractive, original and crisp. In addition to her strong designs, she was timely and a pleasure to work
with. I recommend PJ for any creative signage you may need."
