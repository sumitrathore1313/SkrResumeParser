Projects
Chambergon Battle Logic
August 2013 to Present
Members:Micah Tillman

Chambergon Battle Logic ("CBL") is a puzzle-solving computer card game I designed, and continue to
 improve, for teaching symbolic logic. I used the program as my main in-class, homework, and testing tool
 for teaching two semesters of symbolic logic at McDaniel College.

Philosophy in Four Questions
2014 to 2015
Members:Micah Tillman

This is a textbook I wrote to introduce high schoolers to philosophy. It is intended primarily for use as part
 of homeschooling curricula, but is appropriate for anyone wanting a broad and entertaining introduction to
 philosophy. (Published in 2015 by 7 Sisters IHH, LLC.)

Philosophy of Music
2013 to 2014
Members:Micah Tillman

I proposed, developed, and taught a course for McDaniel College on the sociology, neuroscience, and
 philosophy of music. (The course was given in the spring semester of 2014, but development began in 2013.)

Song Lyrics: Principles of the Lyricist's Art
2013 to Present
Members:Micah Tillman

This is a textbook I was asked to write for a high school course on theater and music. It was meant for
 the second half of the course, and was used at Mt. Sophia Academy (Newark, DE) during the 2013-2014
 academic year. The book will be published by 7 Sisters IHH, LLC.
