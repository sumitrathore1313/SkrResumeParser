WORK EXPERIENCE

Android Developer (Intern)
Byte  -  Austin, TX - August 2015 to Present

I work on bug fixes and feature addition to the Android platform of the Byte application. I work as part of a
very small team to create and maintain a startup app food service with integrated purchasing, geo-fencing,
and restaurant profiling.

Accomplishments
I have had the major opportunity to work as a part of a professional team working on a real-time project that
directly goes out into the hands of hundreds of users daily. 

Skills Used
During my work I use Java programming and develop within Android Studio for the application. I use git version
control to coordinate and work with the small team to simultaneously work on multiple portions of the application
at a time.

I created CheaterCheater as a simple, clean, and easy to use multipurpose word game helper application for
Android.

CheaterCheater helps find all word combinations word game hands including on board pieces, solve Scrabble,
Words With Friends and many other popular word games with this easy to use app! CheaterCheater also
contains a dictionary look up, so if you're playing a game of Scrabble and someone else plays a word, you
can immediately check that word on the current dictionary!

CheaterCheater  uses  the  open  source  ENABLE  word  list  to  give  you  the  most  viable  word  game  words
possible, and unlike many other word game helpers, CheaterCheater does this without any internet connection!
