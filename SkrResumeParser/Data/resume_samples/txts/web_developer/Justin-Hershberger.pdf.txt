• I'm a hardworking, eager student preparing to graduate in Spring 2017. I'm looking for an
opportunity to find a career opportunity that allows me to learn, prosper, interact with team
members, and overcome challenges. I want to gain a deeper understanding of computer science as
well as make relationships along the way. If I can't understand or don't know the solution to a
problem, I will figure it out and learn from that experience. I look forward to any opportunity to
become an asset to a great company.

WORK EXPERIENCE

Web Developer
Space Dynamics Lab  -  Logan, UT - 2016 to Present

Logan, Utah
Enterprise Application Support Team 2016 - Current
- I get experience in both frontend and backend parts of the stack. We use a PostgreSql
database, OpenAcs server, tcl as our server side language, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. We
use jira as our agile work environment and have scrum meetings frequently. Git is our source
control. I also spend time in a unix terminal frequently because we remotely connect to our
server.  I  have  gained  a  lot  of  quality  experience  working  here.  I  can  provide  more  information  about  my
experience here, if wanted.
