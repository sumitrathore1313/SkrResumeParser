My objective is to work for a company that allows me to sharpen my skills and at the same time make a
meaningful contribution.

Having learned everything already by myself and having gone beyond the extent the university takes me, I
have the ability to create high quality applications and I can provide a small test project or images of previous
projects if requested.
Authorized to work in the US for any employer
