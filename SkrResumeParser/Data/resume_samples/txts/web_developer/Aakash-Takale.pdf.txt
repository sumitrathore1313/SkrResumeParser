Data Sharing: Ensure Accountability Distribution in the Cloud
http://www.ijert.org/view.php?id=7938&title=data-sharing-ensure-accountability-distribution-in-the-cloud
February 2014
Cloud  computing  is  highly  emerging  technology  of  the  21st  century.  Cloud  enables  the  user  to  store  the
data also the data can be processed on any of the machine which user does not know. While enjoying the
convenience brought by these new technologies of cloud computing, users fear of losing the hold on their data.
A thorough research is needed for detective controls in the area of accountability and logging, where in some
privacy protection techniques concentrate on preventive controls. We proposed a system that sub-urbanized
information accountability framework to keep track of user’s data in cloud. We chose object-centered approach
to highlight the security purpose by enclosing our logging mechanism together with user’s data along with
policies. The proposed system will also take care of the JAR file by converting it into nebulous code which will
add the further layer of security to the architecture. We ensure accountability gets distributed and providing
more reliable and secure system.
