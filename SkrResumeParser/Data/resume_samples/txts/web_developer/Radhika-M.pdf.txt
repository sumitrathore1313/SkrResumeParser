WORK EXPERIENCE

Web Developer III
Christus Health, TX - May 2012 to Present

CHRISTUS Health is an international Catholic, faith-based, not-for-profit health system comprising almost 350
services and facilities, including more than 60 hospitals and long-term care facilities, 175 clinics and outpatient
centers and dozens of other health ministries and ventures. Its corporate headquarters are in Irving, Texas.

The  project  is  to  migrate  Christus'  old  SharePoint  environment  (SP  2003)  to  SharePoint  2010.  We  used
Metalogix migration tool for the team site migration. This portal was mainly used for Content management.

The corporate portal is the entry point from which all Clients and Employees can get the latest corporate-wide
information. The department portal consists of independent sites for each department. Employees can use
these sites to access news, events, announcements, documents, and any information related to their specific
teams.

Responsibilities:
• Involved in all the phases of SDLC from Software Requirements Phase to Design, Implementation, testing,
debugging and Documentation.
• Customized the look and feel of the sites by developing custom master pages and custom site themes.
• Performed Content Migration of contents from SharePoint 2003 to SharePoint 2010 using Metalogix migration
tool.
• Some of the migrated contents are Document Streams (files), Metadata, Access Controls, Workflows, User
Policy, Web Parts, and Site Definitions etc.
• Used SharePoint 2010 object model to perform various tasks like creation of lists, site columns, retrieving
data from various lists & constructing a web part.
• Used InfoPath forms to develop online forms for the Portal.
• Used BCS to migrate the Data from external data source into SharePoint Lists.
• Worked with SharePoint Designer 2010 for UI Development for Master Pages and to maintain InfoPath forms
in new Christus look and feel.

Environment:
SharePoint 2010, InfoPath 2010, Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2010, IIS 7.0 and MS SQL Server
