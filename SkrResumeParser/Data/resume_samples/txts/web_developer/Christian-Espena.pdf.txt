WORK EXPERIENCE

Web Developer
Talino Digital Asia Inc.  -  Negros Oriental - November 2015 to Present

I am a self-taught developer, learning how to code from looking at websites online and actually getting stuck
in to building things. I have a strong grasp at what I'm doing and always try to out-do my last project.
To  cut  to  the  chase,  I  design  good  user  interfaces  and  can  translate  those  into  semantic,  well  structured
websites. I'm an honest individual who is very helpful and likes to build strong relationships with the people
I work with.

Typesetter
SPi Global Dumaguete  -  Negros Oriental - July 2012 to November 2015

I was one of the first batch who got hired to work for the Laserwords account which is one of the pioneers and
most successful publishing BPO companies in India.

Effectively formulates strategies, tactics, and action plans to drive successful results. Develops successful
