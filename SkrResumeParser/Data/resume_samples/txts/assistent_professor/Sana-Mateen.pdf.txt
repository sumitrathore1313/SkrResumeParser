WORK EXPERIENCE

Assistant Professor
BHOJ REDDY ENGINEERING COLLEGE FOR WOMEN  -  Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh - June 2016 to
Present

I  have  taught  SCRIPTING  LANGUAGES  in  BHOJ  REDDY  WOMENS  ENGINEERING  COLLEGE  for  one
semester.
PROJECT PROFILE
Title: Secure and Efficient Privacy
Preserving Mechanism for Micro-Data
Client side script: JQuery
Server side script: JavaServerPages
Web server: Tomcat 8.0
Integrated Development Environment: NetBeans 8.1
Platform: Windows 8
Description:
This project aims at providing individual privacy for patient records available online in a surveillance portal. It
also facilitates citizens to be aware of a disease outbreak and guides them on what preventive measures and
antibiotics to be taken in order for disease prevention. Entire patient record is uploaded by hospital which is
anonymized by the admin of the portal and later on it is made public so that epidemiologist can suggest the
preventive measures and decision on isolating the place if number of affected person exceeds certain limit.
ACADEMIC ACHEIVEMENTS:
The paper entitled "SECURE AND EFFICIENT PRIVACY PRESERVING MECHANISM FOR MICRODATA"
has been published in International Journal of Scientific Engineering and Technology Research.

SECURE AND EFFICIENT PRIVACY PRESERVING MECHANISM FOR MICRO DATA

:  Access  control  mechanisms  protect  sensitive  information  from  unauthorized  users.  However,  sharing  of
sensitive
information  might  lead  to  identity  disclosure.  A  Privacy  Protection  Module  (PPM)  uses  suppression  and
generalization of
relational data to anonymize and satisfy privacy requirements, e.g., k-anonymity and l-diversity, against identity
and attribute
disclosure. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-constrained privacy-preserving access control framework
where in the access
control policies define selection predicates available to roles while the privacy requirement is to satisfy the k-
anonymity or ldiversity.
An additional constraint that needs to be satisfied by the PPM is the imprecision bound for each selection
predicate.
Although several algorithms have been proposed for anonymizing the data, to the best of our knowledge, the
problem of
satisfying the accuracy constraints for multiple roles has not been studied before.
