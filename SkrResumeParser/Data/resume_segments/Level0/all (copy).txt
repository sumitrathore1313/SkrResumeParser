Web  design  and  software  development  under  waterfall,  and  later,  SCRUM  methodology.  Added  new
functionality
to the Catertrax SaaS platform based on requirements coordinated our sales team. Fixed bugs reported by
phone support staff or tracked down from error logs. Assisted our Quality Assurance team with regression
testing using SmartBear's TestComplete software and scripting languages.

Augmented ordering platform by automating timezone settings. This was done by using an API to geocode
the customer's address, then passing it to a timezone API to calculate the offset from GMT. The settings had
previously been entered manually by support staff and were often inaccurate. My improvement increased the
timeliness of deliveries and eliminated the need for semi-annual updates of timezone offsets, potentially saving
hundreds of man hours.

Created a web service to simulate transmittal of cXML responses from a clients chosen eProcurement
provider. The EP providers' security policy didn't permit outside developers to have test accounts. We were
originally expected to test the interface we were developing by e-mailing or phoning a their contact who would
attempt an order, then notify us of the outcome. Taking the initiative to create the simulator markedly reduced
development time for the entire team and allowed us to deliver ahead of schedule.

Developed an application which retrieved .csv files from a SFTP locations, then performed database updates

as needed. Records could be altered, (soft) deleted or inserted in any specified table depending on settings in a
unique configuration file. It typically ran weekly for clients utilizing site wide "single sign on" logins where up-to-

I created CheaterCheater as a simple, clean, and easy to use multipurpose word game helper application for
Android.

CheaterCheater helps find all word combinations word game hands including on board pieces, solve Scrabble,
Words With Friends and many other popular word games with this easy to use app! CheaterCheater also
contains a dictionary look up, so if you're playing a game of Scrabble and someone else plays a word, you
can immediately check that word on the current dictionary!

CheaterCheater  uses  the  open  source  ENABLE  word  list  to  give  you  the  most  viable  word  game  words
possible, and unlike many other word game helpers, CheaterCheater does this without any internet connection!

Much of the work is heavy LAMP work for creating entirely custom CMSs for all of the sites the company has.

articles with embeds and the donations feature that ties in with PayPal.

and embed it on their site.
◦ Donations to PayPal are done using their rest API and is completely custom.

• Worked on the redesign of several sites that had an old outdated design and an outdated CMS.
• Worked on a new multisite CMS that replaces every different CMS we have for each site. The technology
used for this new multisite CMS is Laravel for server side code and Vue js for user side code.

location.

◦ Complete list and historical data of issues and tasks done to equipment its related components for each
location.
◦  Time  based  maintenance  repeating  tasks  that  recreate  themselves  and  set  themselves  due  based  on
specified time frames.

◦ Store items have set max order amounts for a certain time frame.
◦ Form automatically blocks the ordering items that have already reached their time frame limit and will reset
the item once the time frame is reached.

Data Sharing: Ensure Accountability Distribution in the Cloud
http://www.ijert.org/view.php?id=7938&title=data-sharing-ensure-accountability-distribution-in-the-cloud
February 2014
Cloud  computing  is  highly  emerging  technology  of  the  21st  century.  Cloud  enables  the  user  to  store  the
data also the data can be processed on any of the machine which user does not know. While enjoying the
convenience brought by these new technologies of cloud computing, users fear of losing the hold on their data.
A thorough research is needed for detective controls in the area of accountability and logging, where in some
privacy protection techniques concentrate on preventive controls. We proposed a system that sub-urbanized
information accountability framework to keep track of user’s data in cloud. We chose object-centered approach
to highlight the security purpose by enclosing our logging mechanism together with user’s data along with
policies. The proposed system will also take care of the JAR file by converting it into nebulous code which will
add the further layer of security to the architecture. We ensure accountability gets distributed and providing
more reliable and secure system.

Main Project (M Tech):

Title: DATA ALLOCATION ON WIRELESS CHANNEL USING KEYWORDS
Environment: core java.

Description:

The  rapid  development  of  wireless  network  and  powerful  portable  computer  technologies  has  accelerated
the development of mobile computing technologies and wireless information systems, thus resulting in the
increased and widespread use of mobile computing devices. A large number of mobile users carrying portable
devices will be able to access the information from anywhere and at any time. Energy-and latency-efficiency
are two critical issues in wireless data broadcast system. Two basic performance metrics namely access time
and tuning time are used to measure energy-and latency-Efficiencies. In Wireless Environment broadcasting
is an effective and scalable technique to disseminate information to large number of mobile clients. Several
Indexing  techniques  are  there  for  accessing  data  items  on  Broadcast  channel,  It  reduces  the  tuning  time.
Previously indexing methods were proposed for full text searches they are targeted for data in disk storage.
For text searches in wireless broadcast channel, index scheme using keyword search will be implemented with
the help of inverted list index method and full-text search algorithm. And analysis of index scheme performance
will be done with respect to latency and energy usage. Index scheme will be implemented by using IEEE
802.11.g as communication media.
Solution Provided:
In Wireless environments data broadcasting is widely used for information delivery services due to its beneficial
characteristics such as bandwidth efficiency, energy efficiency and scalability. This project a novel indexing
scheme which is and latency efficient for text retrieval queries on the wireless broadcast data stream has been
implemented. The Text retrieval on the disk storage is different from wireless one.

First, a simple, inverted list-style index method is constructed. In order to reduce the tuning time overhead (i.e.
Energy waste) caused by the sequential scan of the inverted list, an additional level of index structure, which
is the index tree for the inverted list is added. For both methods, their extended versions have been devised,
wherein the inverted list and the index tree are replicated: (1, α) and (1, α (1, β)) methods.
Calculations of access time and Tuning time will be done in both the methods and results shows that Tuning
time of (1, α (1, β)) method is less compare to Tuning time of (1, α) method. Therefore by using two level
index structure (inverted index list and tree index) Full Text search operation can be done faster compare to
single level index structure (inverted index list)

Main Project (B Tech):

Title: Two Way Messaging
Environment: Asp.Net, C#.Net, SQL Server 2005.

Description:

Two  Way  Messaging  platform  which  allows  you  to  receive  SMS,  besides  sending  SMS.  This  allows  you
complete  flexibility  in  managing  your  incoming  message.  You  can  modify/alter  or  delete  these  received
messages  as  per  your  need.  The  Two-Way  SMS  feature  works  using  a  'KEYWORD'  as  identifier  of  your
messages. The keyword should be greater than 4 characters. When an SMS message is received, the gateway
will evaluate the content of the message, and can either execute a program, or connect to an HTTP URL,
based upon the content of the message.
The  decision  of  how  to  process  a  received  message  is  based  upon  the  first  "word"  of  the  received  SMS
message. In the terminology of gateway, this first word of the received message is called the "SMS Command
Prefix". Based upon this "SMS Command Prefix", the gateway will execute a command associated with the
prefix.

Solution Provided:
So many websites which gives information is not up to "user satisfaction". There is a lot of information resources
on internet but nothing can be communicated through cell phones. There is no possibility to send reply to
source. So, we are having ability to send information to users directly to their cell phones which is the most
effective way of advertising. It is also used for institutes, social welfare groups etc. It is satisfactory in security
concerns by building Admin and Gateway modules.

The whole process of the Two Way Messaging application is basically divided in three main modules.

1. Advertiser module
1. Admin module and
2. Gateway module
