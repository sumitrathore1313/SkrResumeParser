functionality
to the Catertrax SaaS platform based on requirements coordinated our sales team. Fixed bugs reported by

testing using SmartBear's TestComplete software and scripting languages.

Augmented ordering platform by automating timezone settings. This was done by using an API to geocode
the customer's address, then passing it to a timezone API to calculate the offset from GMT. The settings had
previously been entered manually by support staff and were often inaccurate. My improvement increased the
timeliness of deliveries and eliminated the need for semi-annual updates of timezone offsets, potentially saving
hundreds of man hours.

Created a web service to simulate transmittal of cXML responses from a clients chosen eProcurement
provider. The EP providers' security policy didn't permit outside developers to have test accounts. We were

development time for the entire team and allowed us to deliver ahead of schedule.

and embed it on their site.
◦ Donations to PayPal are done using their rest API and is completely custom.

• Worked on the redesign of several sites that had an old outdated design and an outdated CMS.
• Worked on a new multisite CMS that replaces every different CMS we have for each site. The technology
used for this new multisite CMS is Laravel for server side code and Vue js for user side code.
