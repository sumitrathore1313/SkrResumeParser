Environment C Posix Threads OpenVPN software Linux 
Role requirement gathering designing developing software system testing 
Description 
Open VPN loadtest software application is designed to load Open VPN software and asses its capabilities in terms of client connections 
Measure the performance of the client connections with respect to stability loss of packets over communication channel latency per client when load on server is high and band width for the clients 
The Open VPN tunnel allows secure connection between clients and server using SSL 
The requirement was to analyze Open VPN software design application to load the Open VPN server with as much clients as possible from single machine till system can t handle and measure the client server communication performance parameters like latency throughput and packet loss 
Multi Sensor data Fusion software for AKASH SAM System 
Jan 2005 Jun 2006 
Employer DRDO Bangalore 
Environment Lynx RTOS C VME Backplane CommunicationRole Developer and integration with other sub systems 
Description 
Multi Sensor data fusion software is the master software on the Battery Command Center BCC controlling the AKASH Surface to Air Missiles where in the information given to commander sitting at the console should be able to see and take decision based on the real 
 threats of the targets 
The target reports are coming from two sensors viz 
Battery Level Radar BLR Fire control radar and Battery Surveillance Radar BSR which need to be fused and presented to commander as one target in consolidated complete air picture 
The fusion process is combination of correlation and association process 
The data seen at BCC should also be sent to a master GCC using serial communication in real time 
Group Command Center GCC simulator for BCC

Employer DRDO Bangalore 
Environment C C Window XP 
Role Designer Developer and integration with the system 
Description 
BCC is single system with fire control radar of some Km range and some degree in azimuth coverage 
The 
GCC takes four to eight such BCC s and give a more complete and better air picture over a wider area 
Thus integration testing with such system for proper development of BCC MSF software is needed 
So simulator is needed for real time communication with BCC to show the correctness of BCC software by both online display and offline logged data after extraction and analysis 
A simulator was developed which runs two parallel threads for input and output 
Queues were maintained maintaining I P and O P buffers 
The communication incorporates full handshake through serial portsPROJECTS
